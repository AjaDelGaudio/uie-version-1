                Imagine showing clients your work in Week 1, before any details are
                refined or big decisions made. How would they respond? Ben Callahan
                knows, and he’ll tell you how his team transitioned away from a
                linear design process with a big reveal–ta-da!

                populations–UX designers are poised to make data-driven design a
                standard practice. And gathering that data is easier than ever if
                you listen to Cyd Harrell, whose quick tips for doing mobile

                For years, we treated the web as a fixed canvas that reacted only to
                keyboard and mouse inputs. Now we have touch screens, cameras, voice
                control, and sensors–but how do we design for the explosion of these
                dynamic inputs? Jason Grigsby has some ideas you’ll want to hear.
